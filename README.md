### Reference-free Cell-type Annotation for Single-cell Transcriptomics using Deep Learning with a Weighted Graph Neural Network
Recent advance in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled large-scale transcriptional characterization of thousands of cells in multiple complex tissues, in which accurate cell type identification becomes the prerequisite and vital step for scRNA-seq studies. 

To addresses this challenge, we developed a reference-free cell-type annotation method, namely scDeepSort, using a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, i.e. a modified graph neural network (GNN) model. Itâ€™s the first time that GNN is introduced into scRNA-seq studies and demonstrate its ground-breaking performances in this application scenario. In brief, scDeepSort was constructed based on our weighted GNN framework and was then learned in two embedded high-quality scRNA-seq atlases containing 764,741 cells across 88 tissues of human and mouse, which are the most comprehensive multiple-organs scRNA-seq data resources to date. For more information, please refer to a preprint in [bioRxiv 2020.05.13.094953.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.094953v1)

# Install

[![download:pretrained.tar.gz](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-pretrained.tar.gz-blue)](https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/scDeepSort/releases/download/v2.0/pretrained.tar.gz)

1. Download source codes of scDeepSort.
2. Download pretrained models from the release page and uncompress them.
```
tar -xzvf pretrained.tar.gz
```

After executing the above steps, the final scDeepSort tree should look like this:

# Usage

### Prepare test data

1. The file name of test data should be named in this format: **species_TissueNumber_data.csv**. For example, `human_Pancreas11_data.csv` is a data file containing 11 human pancreas cells.
2. The test single-cell transcriptomics csv data file should be normalized with the defalut `LogNormalize` method with `Seurat` (R package), wherein the column represents each cell and the row represent each gene, as shown below.

      |          |Cell 1|Cell 2|Cell 3|...  |
      | :---:    |:---: | :---:| :---:|:---:|
      |__Gene 1__|    0 | 2.4  |  5.0 |...  |
      |__Gene 2__| 0.8  | 1.1  |  4.3 |...  |
      |__Gene 3__|1.8   |    0 |  0   |...  |
      |  ...     |  ... |  ... | ...  |...  |



3. All the test data should be included under the `test` directory. Furthermore, all of the human testing datasets and mouse testing datasets are required to be under `./test/human` and `./test/mouse` respectively.

### Run

#### Evaluate
To evaluate one data file `mouse_Liver4122_data.csv`, which we report the prediction accuracy in the paper, you should execute the following command:
```shell script
python run.py --species human --tissue Liver --test_dataset 4122 --gpu -1 --evaluate
```
- ``--species`` The species of cells, `human` or `mouse`.
- ``--tissue`` The tissue of cells. see __Details__
- ``--test_dataset`` The dataset to be tested, in other words, as the file naming rule states, it is exactly the number of cells in the data file.
- ``--gpu`` Specify the GPU to use, `-1` for cpu.

#### Test
To test one data file `human_Pancreas11.csv`, you should execute the following command:
```shell script
python run.py --species human --tissue Pancreas --test_dataset 11 --gpu -1 --test
```
- ``--species`` The species of cells, `human` or `mouse`.
- ``--tissue`` The tissue of cells. see __Details__
- ``--test_dataset`` The dataset to be tested, in other words, as the file naming rule states, it is exactly the number of cells in the data file.
- ``--gpu`` Specify the GPU to use, `-1` for cpu.

### Output
For each dataset, it will output a `.csv` file named as `species_Tissue_Number.csv` under the `result` directory. For example, output of test dataset `human_Pancreas11_data.csv` is `human_Pancreas_11.csv`

**Evaluate:**

Each line of the output file corresponds to the original cell type and predictive cell type.

**Test:**

Each line of the output file corresponds to the predictive cell type.
